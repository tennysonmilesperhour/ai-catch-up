# CLAUDE.md

Persistent context for Claude Code on this project. Read this file at the start of every session.

## Project overview

V1.0 of an AI onboarding product for solo entrepreneurs and small-team leads who became the de facto AI lead by default. Price: $49 one-time. V1.0 ships the marketing site and admin dashboard only; the product delivery flow is v1.1. The buyer sees the landing page, pays via a Stripe payment link, and is redirected to a "thank you, video coming soon" page. Owner: Tennyson (non-developer). Claude Code is the primary builder and deployment engineer.

## Handoff protocol (critical, do not violate)

There are two Claude instances working on this product:

1. **Claude Code (this repo)** - owns code, structure, deployment.
2. **Strategy Claude (claude.ai web)** - owns content, copy, design decisions, positioning.

Rules:

- **Never edit files in `/content/` based on your own judgment.** Those files are content decisions owned by Strategy Claude and Tennyson.
- When Tennyson wants content changed, instructions arrive in `HANDOFF.md` with the form: "Replace `/content/landing/hero.mdx` with this:" followed by new content.
- At the start of every session, read `HANDOFF.md`. If it contains pending instructions, execute them, then delete the processed instructions and log a one-line summary in that file's "Completed handoffs" section.
- You **can** edit `/components/`, `/app/`, `/middleware.ts`, config files, and everything outside `/content/` freely.
- You **can** edit `/content/` when Tennyson directly asks you to, or when `HANDOFF.md` instructs you to.

## Tech stack (locked, do not suggest alternatives)

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Content:** MDX for copy, JSON for structured data
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Payment:** Stripe payment link (URL pasted into env var)
- **Email capture:** POST to `/api/subscribe`, which appends to `/data/subscribers.json` (v1.0 only; upgrades to a real email service in v1.1)
- **Admin auth:** password-only via `middleware.ts`, password in `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var
- **Database:** none in v1.0. Everything static or file-based.

## Voice reference

The Anti-Engineer brand brief (`docs/brand/anti-engineer-brief.md`) is the source of truth for voice, persona, and worldview. Read it before writing any new copy or briefing Strategy Claude. Hooks are mirrored at `docs/brand/hooks.md`.

The brief is a voice-and-worldview layer only. As of the 2026-05-08 decision, **the price stays $49 and the aesthetic stays Aurora Command**. Do not adopt the brief's $97 / "The Anti-Engineer's Stack" / print-zine aesthetic without an explicit new instruction.

Run `npm run voice-check` to scan `/content/**/*.{md,mdx}` for em-dashes, corporate softeners, and italics. The script reports only; pass `--strict` to make it fail.

## Design rules

- **No em dashes anywhere** in code or content. Use regular dashes, commas, or parentheses. Hard rule, no exceptions.
- **Tone:** warm, refined, editorial. Not tech-startup-generic.
- **Primary font:** Georgia serif (body and headers).
- **Secondary font:** `ui-monospace`, Menlo (labels, nav, technical elements).
- **Color palette:**
  - Background: `#faf7f2` (warm cream)
  - Dark sections: `#2a2520`, `#1a1612`
  - Primary accent: `#d97757` (terracotta)
  - Secondary accent: `#c96442` (rust)
  - Muted: `#8a7f6b`, `#5c5248`
  - Border: `#d4cdbf`, `#e5ddd0`, `#3a342c`
- Admin dashboard uses darker palette for the header, lighter for content.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local    # then fill in values
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:3000
```

Public site: `/`
Admin: `/admin` (redirects to `/admin/login` if not authenticated)

## Deploying

Vercel is connected to the GitHub repo. Pushing to `main` triggers a production deploy. Env vars must be set in the Vercel dashboard:

- `STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`

## Development branch

Active work happens on `claude/ai-onboarding-v1-RTsDk`. Merge to `main` for production deploys.

## Current focus

_(Update as work progresses.)_

- Scaffolding v1.0 marketing site and admin dashboard.
